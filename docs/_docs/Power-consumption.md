!This is only measured for **Push7** as the power consumption is not relevant for IOWAY as it's permanently plugged in!

## Power consumption modes

Some different consumptions were measured to determine the battery lifetime, a table of some modes:

| Mode             | Power Consumed                 | Estimated duration |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Standby               | x Î¼A    | - |
| Transmission low power (15)        | x mA                | x ms |
| Transmission high power (17)                | x mA        | x ms |

## Battery lifetime

The following plot shows continuous transmissions for the entire capacity of the battery. In total we sent X messages before the battery dying.
