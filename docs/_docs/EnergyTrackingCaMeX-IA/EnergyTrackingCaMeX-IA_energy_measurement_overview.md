A separate fuse box with DIN rails was provided to make the installation easier on site. The fuse box has three 1 ampere circuit breakers (located in the top right corner) which protect the three-phase voltage line connections. There is also a fourth circuit breaker located in the top left corner. This circuit breaker protects the supplied voltage to the energy measurement device, which is a black box located in the middle of the top row. The fourth circuit breaker also protects the supplied voltage to a 5 volt regulator located in the bottom left corner. The 5 volt regulator then provides voltage to a Modbus to dash7 device (located in the bottom right corner). All the devices used in this project are designed to be installed on DIN rails, ensuring proper installation.

During the installation process, the electrician only needed to connect the Rogowski coils to the energy measurement device and make the three-phase voltage connections to the circuit breaker. In addition, extra circuit breakers were added to the original fuse box to allow for the connections to be turned off on both sides.
