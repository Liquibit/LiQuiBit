A dedicated fuse box equipped with DIN rails was provided to simplify the on-site installation. This fuse box includes [three 1-ampere circuit breakers](https://benl.rs-online.com/p/mcbs/8496572) (located on the right) that protect the three-phase voltage line connections. Additionally, there is a [fourth circuit breaker](https://benl.rs-online.com/p/mcbs/2650178) situated to the left of the energy measurement device. This fourth circuit breaker safeguards the supplied voltage to [the energy measurement device](https://www.accuenergy.com/products/acurev-1310-din-rail-power-energy-meter/), identified as the black device in the middle. Furthermore, this circuit breaker also protects the voltage supplied to a [5-volt regulator](https://benl.rs-online.com/p/din-rail-power-supplies/2259899) positioned to the left of it. The 5-volt regulator, in turn, powers the Modbus to DASH7 device, which is situated in the leftmost position. All components used in this project are designed for DIN rail installation, ensuring a secure and standardized setup.

During the installation, the electrician only needed to connect the Rogowski coils to the energy measurement device and link the three-phase voltage connections to the circuit breaker. Additional circuit breakers were installed in the original fuse box to facilitate the ability to switch off connections on both sides.
